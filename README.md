UniTube
=======

UniTube is an open source YouTube alternative client built with .NET
technologies to provide an incredible experience on Windows 10, Android or
Linux devices.

UniTube in Windows 10 uses the new APIs of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
to offer an elegant design with smooth animations, following the guidelines of
Fluent Design, provided by Microsoft.

On Android, UniTube makes use of the new components of the renewed Material
Design to provide a comfortable user experience on large screens. Support is
provided for Android 5.0 Lollipop or higher.

And of course, in Linux, UniTube uses the GTK+ framework, following the GNOME
Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), to provide a design consistent with most
available desktop environments.
